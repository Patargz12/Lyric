        title: "Lyric: The Philippines' Leading Music Store Since 1964 â€“ From Piano Manufacturer to Full-Line Musical Instrument Retailer",
        content: "Lyric is the Philippines' largest musical instrument retail chain. It was founded in 1964 by Mr. Severo Panganiban as a supplier of parts and accessories to piano manufacturers. In 1968, it evolved into manufacturing its own pianos for the domestic market and, after a few years, exported its first set of pianos under its own label. In order to meet the local demand for imported pianos, Lyric acquired the distributorship of Samick and Kohler & Campbell pianos. Soon thereafter, Wurlitzer and Baldwin pianos were also acquired. By 1998, Lyric assumed the exclusive local distributorship of pianos Boston and Steinway & Sons. Yamaha, Kawai and Fazioli are its current biggest piano brands.",

            "To support its sales outlets, Lyric has a well-organized service center with trained staff and technicians. They are being trained in Japan and Germany to fully support and maintain the musical instruments being offered by the company to the public. It also maintains a spare parts and accessories outlet to supply the instruments it carries with original parts straight from manufacturers.",
            "Although famous for its piano heritage, Lyric has now expanded to become a full-line music store as they offer official distributorship of world-renowned instrument brands such as Yamaha guitars and drums; Peavey amplifiers; PRS guitars; ESP guitars; Warwick basses; DW drums; Meinl cymbals; Digitech effects; Mono bags; and Nord keyboards. It also expanded into professional audio with the acquisition of select brands as JBL speakers, Soundcraft mixers; AKG microphones; Peavey speakers; and DAS, to name a few. With 50 years in the business, Lyric has retail branches in the most accessible locations and continues to expand across the country. It has dedicated itself to ensure that Filipino music fans can grow and play the best brands with Lyric."
