            Lyric: The Philippines' Leading Music Store Since 1964 â€“ From Piano
            Manufacturer to Full-Line Musical Instrument Retailer
          </h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Lyric is the Philippines' largest musical instrument retail chain.
            It was founded in 1964 by Mr. Severo Panganiban as a supplier of
            parts and accessories to piano manufacturers. In 1968, it evolved
            into manufacturing its own pianos for the domestic market and, after
            a few years, exported its first set of pianos under its own label.
            In order to meet the local demand for imported pianos, Lyric
            acquired the distributorship of Samick and Kohler & Campbell pianos.
            Soon thereafter, Wurlitzer and Baldwin pianos were also acquired. By
            1998, Lyric assumed the exclusive local distributorship of pianos
            Boston and Steinway & Sons. Yamaha, Kawai and Fazioli are its
            current biggest piano brands.

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            To support its sales outlets, Lyric has a well-organized service
            center with trained staff and technicians. They are being trained in
            Japan and Germany to fully support and maintain the musical
            instruments being offered by the company to the public. It also
            maintains a spare parts and accessories outlet to supply the
            instruments it carries with original parts straight from
            manufacturers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Although famous for its piano heritage, Lyric has now expanded to
            become a full-line music store as they offer official
            distributorship of world-renowned instrument brands such as Yamaha
            guitars and drums; Peavey amplifiers; PRS guitars; ESP guitars;
            Warwick basses; DW drums; Meinl cymbals; Digitech effects; Mono
            bags; and Nord keyboards. It also expanded into professional audio
            with the acquisition of select brands as JBL speakers, Soundcraft
            mixers; AKG microphones; Peavey speakers; and DAS, to name a few.
            With 50 years in the business, Lyric has retail branches in the most
            accessible locations and continues to expand across the country. It
            has dedicated itself to ensure that Filipino music fans can grow and
            play the best brands with Lyric.
